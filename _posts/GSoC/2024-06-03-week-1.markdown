The first week was fairly informative. Following is a list of my learnings this week:
- Learned quite a lot about how the Cytoscape apps work and how they are written.
- Running cytoscape in debug mode and listening to the debug port from intellij by setting up debug configurations.
- OSGi model and how cytoscape uses it to structure the software.
- How to write OSGi configurations.
- How to add the instance of the cytoscape app in the menu bar of cytoscape.
- How nodes and networks are modeled in cytoscape.
- Following things related to Nodes in networks
    - Creating nodes
    - Naming the nodes
    - Creating edges
    - Node table entries
- Following things related to cytoscape apps
    - Tasks
    - Task factories
    - Network views
    - Network managers

Further i plan to take a look at how cytoscape exports networks in the form of cytoscape.js json file.
