The fifth week was mainly focused on writing the functionalities as an implementation of the abstract layout algorithm laid down in cytoscape.

### TODOs
- [x] Extend `AbstractLayoutAlgorithm`.
- [x] Implement fCoSE layout algorithm in the plugin.
- [x] Implement the task iterator to apply the layout changes to the network in cytoscape.
- [x] Implement `doLayout` method to apply the layout changes to the network in cytoscape. 

### Experiments with code
- Extended the `AbstractLayoutAlgorithm` class to implement the fCoSE layout algorithm. Using the previously developed knowledge and code, the migration to extend the abstract class was smooth.

```java
public class CustomLayout extends AbstractLayoutAlgorithm {
	/**
	 * Creates a new MyLayout object.
	 */
	private final CyNetworkViewWriterFactory writeCyJs;

	public CustomLayout(UndoSupport undo, CyNetworkViewWriterFactory writeNetwork) {
		super("customLayout","Custom Layout", undo);
		this.writeCyJs = writeNetwork;
	}

	public TaskIterator createTaskIterator(CyNetworkView networkView,
                                            Object context,
                                            Set<View<CyNode>> nodesToLayOut,
                                            String attrName) {
		final CyNetworkView myView = networkView;
		final CyNetworkViewWriterFactory writeCyJs = this.writeCyJs;
		Task task = new AbstractLayoutTask(toString(), networkView, nodesToLayOut, attrName, undoSupport) {
            @Override
			protected void doLayout(TaskMonitor taskMonitor) {
                    //.....
				}		
			}
		};
		return new TaskIterator(task);
	}
}
```

### Learnings
- The `AbstractLayoutAlgorithm` class provides a lot of functionalities that can be used to implement the layout algorithms in cytoscape.
- The `createTaskIterator` method is used to create a task iterator which is used to apply the layout changes to the network in cytoscape.
- The `doLayout` method is used to apply the layout changes to the network in cytoscape.
- Cytoscape layouts also offer layout context which can be used to get and set the parameters for the layout from the user.

## Milestones
### Successful implementation of fCoSE layout algorithm in the plugin.
